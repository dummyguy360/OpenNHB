OpenNHB
	A Decompilation of Noise's Halloween Bash (Version 1.0.0)
		by burnedpopcorn180

GameMaker Version Used: 2023.11.1.129

Packages Used
- GMEXT-FMOD v1.0.4
- NekoPresence
- GameFrame
- Input v8.0.3
- DotObj v5.5.0
- Easings

This Project uses a lot of code from '19 Plus
So that's convenient

GMLive was used during the development of this game, but the devs "removed" it at release
As in it technically still exists, but all GMLive Extension code is empty and non-functional
(Probably to not spend too much time removing all GMLive code from the project)
